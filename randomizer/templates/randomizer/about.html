    <h1>What is the Super Mario RPG Web Randomizer?</h1>
    <div class="card card-body bg-light border my-2">
        <p>A program that shuffles around a bunch of stuff in Super Mario RPG! The world looks the same, the game's objective is the same, but plenty of things can get shuffled around &mdash; such as playable characters, monsters, progression items, shop items, character/equipment/monster stats, and even Star Pieces! It's a different experience every time!</p>

    <h1>Woah cool! Where do I download this?</h1>
